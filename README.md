# Requester Sample Contract

Interested in integrating with the Flux Oracle? **Requester Contracts** can be used to create and submit data requests to the Flux Oracle -- here you will find a sample contract to get you started!

On the testnet deployment, anyone can test their own Request Contract with the testnet oracle. When the Oracle is deployed to mainnet, each Requester will require a successful proposal and execution by the Flux DAO. Any protocol or user-deployed smart contract can experiment directly with the Flux Oracle as a data requester and put any kind of data on-chain to be resolved by our pool of testnet validators.

[Please visit the documentation](https://docs.fluxprotocol.org/docs/getting-started/data-requesters) for more information on getting set up as a data requester!

## Building and deploying

```bash
REQUESTOR=myRequestor.account.testnet
ACCOUNT=account.testnet

sh build.sh

bash scripts/deploy_requestor.sh --accountId $REQUESTOR

bash scripts/reset_account.sh --master $ACCOUNT --account $REQUESTOR
```

## Options

### Whitelist

Requesters are encouraged to create mechanisms to ensure domain-specific and high-quality (with definite answers, not spammy, etc.) requests are sent to the Flux Oracle to encourage validators to participate in data resolution.

One option is to whitelist the account(s) allowed to call `create_data_request()` by deploying the contract with an array of account IDs for the `whitelist` parameter in the `init()` method. If left empty, any account will be able to call `create_data_request()`, so another mechanism to limit the number of requests sent to the oracle (e.g. time-based limits, governance controls) is encouraged.
